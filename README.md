# CureMD-Question2
Solution to the implementation of the Question 2 in the CureMD Research Aptitude Test

Hi there!

There are two folders in this repository:

1. Notebooks: This folder includes the .ipynb file that contains the test submission code
2. Dataset: This folder includes the .csv file downloaded from Kaggle

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle and includes a .csv file with 70,000 patient records!
Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset

In order to use this project, simply download both files, set the data_path variable to the directory where you put the dataset and run the code.
You may have to have some packages like keras, numpy, matplotlib etc. installed on your system to make the code work.
